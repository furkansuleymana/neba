> I decided to replace Fiber with the Go standard library's net/http package. My goal is to become more familiar with the standard library first. Similarly, I’ve chosen to forgo Chakra and focus on building my own components. I think it’s important to understand the foundational concepts that led to the creation of tools like Gin, Fiber or Chakra before diving into them, so I’m keeping things minimal until I gain more familiarity.

> I’ve also started to grasp how to serve static directories, such as Vite distributions, from Go binaries. I like how Go handles this aspect, and I start feeling confident about my tech stack choice. Go will serve as the backend, handling communication with all devices while also serving the frontend, which is essentially a React app. This setup allows users to access Neba from any device with a modern web browser. Additionally, since the backend operates like a daemon on the server, I can work on features like recursive tasks or rules/events in the future. Having a daemon will be useful.

> My primary goal with Neba is to gain a deeper understanding of the software production workflow. In the past, I typically created projects based on requests or personal needs, but I’ve never released a fully functional software product. With Neba, I aim to develop something valuable and continuously improve it over time. TBH, I’m very excited about the journey ahead and hope to stay committed to this project.
