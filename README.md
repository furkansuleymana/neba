# Neba

Neba is an open-source tool designed to provide a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Axis
Communications devices that support the [VAPIX API](https://developer.axis.com/vapix). This project is currently under
active development. Breaking changes will occur.

## Overview

Neba aims to simplify the management of Axis products, especially in environments with multiple devices. It operates on
a server-client architecture and features a lightweight, cross-platform design.

The backend, written in Go, is compiled for Windows, macOS, and Linux, running as a daemon on a server located at the
user's site. This server can be the same machine hosting Axis Camera Station or a single-board computer like a Raspberry
Pi. It uses a local database to store configuration and operational data.

The frontend is created with web technologies and is accessible through any modern web browser. To simplify installation
and usage, itâ€™s embedded directly into the Go binary. The interface is designed to be responsive, making it easy to
manage devices from smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers.

## Installation

Neba is not yet operational.

## Development

Ensure you have [Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/install) or later installed. To build the application, simply execute
