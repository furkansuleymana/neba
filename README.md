# Neba

Neba is an open-source tool designed to provide a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Axis Communications devices that support the VAPIX API. The name "Neba" stands for "Not Endorsed By Axis". While the tool is designed for Axis products, it is an independent project with no official affiliation or endorsement from Axis Communications.

This project is currently under active development. Breaking changes will occur.

## Overview

Neba aims to simplify the management of Axis products, especially in environments with multiple devices. It operates on a server-client architecture and features a lightweight, cross-platform design.

The backend, written in Go, is compiled for Windows, macOS, and Linux, running as a daemon on a server located at the user's site. This server can be the same machine hosting Axis Camera Station or a single-board computer like a Raspberry Pi. It uses a local database to store configuration and operational data.

The frontend is created with web technologies and is accessible through any modern web browser. To simplify installation and usage, itâ€™s embedded directly into the Go binary. The interface is designed to be responsive, making it easy to manage devices from smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers.

## Key Features
