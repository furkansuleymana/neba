# Neba

Neba is a lightweight, cross-platform, and open-source tool designed to provide a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing Axis Communications devices that support the [VAPIX API](https://developer.axis.com/vapix).

This project is currently under active development. Breaking changes will occur.

## Overview

Neba aims to simplify the management of Axis products, especially in environments with multiple devices. It operates on
a server-client architecture and features a lightweight, cross-platform design.

The backend, written in Go, is compiled for Windows, macOS, and Linux, running as a daemon on a server located at the
user's site. This server can be the same machine hosting Axis Camera Station or a single-board computer like a Raspberry
Pi. It uses a local database to store configuration and operational data.

The frontend is created with web technologies and is accessible through any modern web browser. To simplify installation
and usage, itâ€™s embedded directly into the Go binary. The interface is designed to be responsive, making it easy to
manage devices from smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers.

## Installation

Neba is in its very early stages, but you can still [give it a try](https://github.com/furkansuleymana/neba/releases/latest)!

## Known Issues

If your firewall is blocking UDP multicast traffic, which is essential for SSDP, Neba will be unable to detect any devices. To resolve this issue, you can either temporarily disable the firewall for testing using the command `sudo systemctl stop firewalld` in some Linux distributions, or add Neba to the firewall's allowlist. The same applies to macOS and Windows.

## Development

Ensure you have [Go 1.22](https://go.dev/doc/install) or later installed. To build the application, simply execute `./make.sh tidy && ./make.sh prod`
in the main project directory. Additional build commands like `dev` and `clean` can be found in the [`make.sh`](make.sh) file.

## Key Features

- [x] Find all Axis products using SSDP
- [ ] Perform factory resets or restart devices
- [ ] Retrieve server reports, system logs, or client logs
